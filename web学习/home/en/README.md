- title: javascript
  details: JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a lightweight, interpreted or just-in-time compiled high-level programming language with function first. Although it is famous as a scripting language for developing Web pages, it is also used in many non-browser environments. JavaScript is based on prototype programming, a multi-paradigm dynamic scripting language, and supports object-oriented, imperative and declarative ( Such as functional programming) style.
- title: jQuery
  details: jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript framework. It is another excellent JavaScript code library (or JavaScript framework) after Prototype. The purpose of jQuery design is "write Less, Do More", that is, advocating to write less code and do more things. It encapsulates JavaScript commonly used function codes, provides a simple JavaScript design mode, optimizes HTML document operation, event handling, animation design and Ajax interaction.
- title: vue.js
  details: Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, similar to view) is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other large frameworks, Vue is designed to be applied layer by layer from the bottom up. Vue's core library only focuses on the view layer, which facilitates integration with third-party libraries or existing projects.
- title: react.js
  details: React originated from Facebook's internal project. Because the company was not satisfied with all the JavaScript MVC frameworks on the market, it decided to write a set of its own to build an Instagram website. After making it, I found that this set of things is very useful, and it was open sourced in May 2013.
